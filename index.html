      <section class="text">
        <p>The presence of fentanyl in NYC’s drug supply continues to rise, causing a number of opioid deaths. Contrary to what the public may think, 1% of Opioid overdoses only occur in nightlife precincts. However, across the five boroughs exists communities and organizations that are working to promote safer alternatives to preventing overdoses - with nightlife at the forefront of this movement. Just recently, Brooklyn Council Member Chi Ossé along with 36 co-sponsors have passed the “Nightlife Opioid Antagonist Program.” This program ensures that naloxone or narcan, an opioid overdose reversal drug, will be available to all bars and nightclubs beginning January 23rd 2022. “Narcan is a better safe than sorry scenario, we are taking advantage of the fact that (nightlife) and these spaces are opportunities where people can look out for one another and educate each other,” commented Ariel Palitz, Senior Executive Director of the Office of Nightlife.  </p>
        <p>In order to best inform this story, I chose the following graphics below as visual representations of each key fact. For example, the ambulance icon is meant to describe the work of first responders and how they have reacted to overdose situations. The second icon depicts a relation to the deaths with a flatlining visual. The third icon includes a dancing individual, relating to the positive statistics of narcan use. Lastly, the last icon with the heart demonstrates a band-aid on it, paired with an explanation of how narcan works to reverse an overdose.

            <p>Naloxone (narcan) quickly reverses an overdose by blocking the effects of opioids. It can restore normal breathing within 2 to 3 minutes in a person whose breath has slowed, or even stopped, as a result of opioid overdose.</p>
